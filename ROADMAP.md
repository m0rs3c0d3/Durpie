## Security Considerations

### For Users
- Always get written authorization
- Document your scope clearly
- Don't store credentials in config.py (use env vars)
- Review findings before reporting (false positives)
- Respect rate limits

### For Contributors
- No hardcoded malicious payloads that phone home
- All external connections must be opt-in
- Payload files should be educational, not weaponized
- Include ethical use warnings
- Test against intentionally vulnerable apps (DVWA, WebGoat, Juice Shop)

---

## Contributing

### Good First Issues
1. Add more SQLi payloads for specific databases
2. Improve error messages
3. Add documentation for a scanner
4. Create test cases against DVWA

2. Add response pattern to fingerprinter
3. Create Intruder attack type
4. Build wordlist generator

3. Build race condition framework
4. Create report generator
